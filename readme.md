# LEARNING ABOUT REACTJS 


we call this single page application because their only one index.html page exists  

ReactDOM implementation of react in web and for mobile app ReactNative for mobile apps

ReactDOM creates its own dom which we call as VirtualDOM and it compares with web dom and then send neccessary elemnts for showing web page 

in react (package.json me react , react dom and react scripts bhi hoti ise waja se react ke index.html me script lekhte nahi hai kuyki vo at run add the script of index.js ) 

but in vite we need to write in index.html


if we want to use the component in one area instead of their above then we do prop drilling and for this context Api use as we globalised this componenet 

and context api is purely for react so  for other their is REDUX 

using in react we use react-Redux 

and its easier library available that is RTK(Redux-toolkit)

other that can do this state management system uis zustand

## Redux

for working context we want react and react-dom library same as for redux we have to use Redux and react-Redux(creates a bridge for react and redux connection) libraries

before redux their is flux present which is architected by facebook bcz they also got the same state management problem
